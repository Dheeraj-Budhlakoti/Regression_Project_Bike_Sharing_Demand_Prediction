This project aims to predict the demand for bike sharing services based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and historical usage patterns. By building an accurate machine learning model, we can optimize bike allocation, improve service reliability, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Project Structure
The project repository contains the following files and directories:

* `data`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the demand prediction model. Ensure that the dataset is stored in the correct location before running the code.
* `notebook`: This directory contains Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
* `models`: Pickle files of the trained demand prediction models.
* `README.md`: This file provides a brief overview of the project and its contents.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
* Place the bike sharing dataset in the correct location.
* Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, develop the demand prediction model, and evaluate its performance.
* Run the Python scripts in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the prediction model, and visualize the results.

## Usage
To use the trained demand prediction model for bike sharing, follow these steps:

* Load the trained prediction model using the provided script or notebook.
* Provide the necessary input features (e.g., weather conditions, time of day) for a specific time and location.
* Apply necessary data transformations on input features.
* Use the model to predict the bike demand for that time and location.
* Optimize bike allocation, plan maintenance, and improve user experience based on the predicted demand.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are encouraged! If you encounter any issues, have ideas for improvements, or want to extend the project's functionality, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions can help enhance bike sharing services and make them more efficient and user-friendly.
